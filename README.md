# weather-forecasting

Using react framework I've created a simple weather forecasting web app using Openweathermap api.


Just type 
### `npm install`
to install node_modules and then type 

### `npm start`

to run the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
